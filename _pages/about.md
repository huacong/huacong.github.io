# About Me

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I'm Cong Hua (华聪, E-mail: huacong23z@ict.ac.cn). Now I am a PhD. student of **Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS)**, supervised by Prof. [Qingming Huang](https://qmhuang-ucas.github.io/) (IEEE Fellow) and [Qianqian Xu](https://qianqianxu010.github.io/) (Professor at ICT, CAS). I have received the B.E. degree in computer science and technology from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/), advised by [Yu Jiang](https://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1028/19116.htm) and [Yue Gao](https://www.gaoyue.org/). My research interests include machine learning and multi-modal learning. I have authored or co-authored several academic papers in top-tier international conferences and journals, including ICML and TNNLS. If you are interested in my research, please email me at <a href="huacong23z@ict.ac.cn">huacong23z@ict.ac.cn</a>.


<!-- I am also lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with [Zhiyong Yang (杨智勇)](https://joshuaas.github.io/) (Assistant Professor at UCAS) and [Yangbangyan Jiang (姜阳邦彦)](https://jiangyangby.github.io/) (Postdoc at UCAS). -->
