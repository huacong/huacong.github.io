# About Me

<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I'm Zitai Wang (ÁéãÂ≠êÊ≥∞, E-mail: wangzitai@iie.ac.cn). Now I am a PhD. student of **Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS)**, supervised by Prof. [Qingming Huang (ÈªÑÂ∫ÜÊòé)](https://qmhuang-ucas.github.io/) (IEEE Fellow). I am also lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with [Qianqian Xu (ËÆ∏ÂÄ©ÂÄ©)](https://qianqianxu010.github.io/) (Professor at Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), CAS.), [Xiaochun Cao (ÊìçÊôìÊò•)](http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xiaochun) (Professor at Sun Yat-sen University, Shenzhen Compus, China), [Zhiyong Yang (Êù®Êô∫Âãá)](https://joshuaas.github.io/) (postdoc at UCAS) and [Ke Ma (È©¨Âù∑)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ke_Ma10) (postdoc at UCAS).

My research interest includes machine learning and data mining. I have authored or co-authored several academic papers in top-tier international conferences and journals, including T-PAMI, NeurIPS, and ACM Multimedia.
